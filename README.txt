main.py, README.txt, example-run.txt


===============
| Description |
===============

(a) which NYC Open Data data set(s) you used to generate the INTEGRATED-DATASET file; (b) what (high-level) procedure you used to map the original NYC Open Data data set(s) into your INTEGRATED-DATASET file; (c) what makes your choice of INTEGRATED-DATASET file interesting (in other words, justify your choice of NYC Open Data data set(s)). The explanation should be detailed enough to allow us to recreate your INTEGRATED-DATASET file exactly from scratch from the NYC Open Data site.


==============
| How to Run |
==============

A clear description of how to run your program (note that your project must compile/run under Linux in your CS account);


===================
| Internal Design |
===================

A clear description of the internal design of your project; in particular, if you decided to implement variation(s) of the original a-priori algorithm (see above), you must explain precisely what variation(s) you have implemented and why.


==============
| Sample Run |
==============

The command line specification of an interesting sample run (i.e., a min_sup, min_conf combination that produces interesting results). Briefly explain why the results are interesting.
